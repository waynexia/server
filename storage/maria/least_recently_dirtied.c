  To be part of the page cache.
  The pseudocode below is dependent on the page cache
  which is being designed WL#3134. It is not clear if I need to do page
  copies, as the page cache already keeps page copies.
  So, this code will move to the page cache and take inspiration from its
  methods. Below is just to give the idea of what could be done.
  And I should compare my imaginations to WL#3134.

  When we flush a page, we should pin page.
  This "pin" is to protect against that:
  I make copy,
  you modify in memory and flush to disk and remove from LRD and from cache,
  I write copy to disk,
  checkpoint happens.
  result: old page is on disk, page is absent from LRD, your REDO will be
  wrongly ignored.

  Pin: there can be multiple pins, flushing imposes that there are zero pins.
  For example, pin could be a uint counter protected by the page's latch.

  Maybe it's ok if when there is a page replacement, the replacer does not
  remove page from the LRD (it would save global mutex); for that, background
  flusher should be prepared to see pages in the LRD which are not in the page
  cache (then just ignore them). However checkpoint will contain superfluous
  entries and so do more work.

  Optimization:
  LRD flusher should not flush pages one by one: to be fast, it flushes a
  group of pages in sequential disk order if possible; a group of pages is just
  FLUSH_GROUP_SIZE pages.
  Key cache has groupping already somehow Monty said (investigate that).

  We don't want to probe for checkpoint requests all the time (it takes

  If FLUSH_GROUP_SIZE is 8MB, assuming a local disk which can write 30MB/s
  (1.8GB/min), probing every 16th call to flush_one_group_from_LRD() is every
  16*8=128MB which is every 128/30=4.2second.
  Using a power of 2 gives a fast modulo operation.
