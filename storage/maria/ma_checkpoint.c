  WL#3071 Maria checkpoint
  First version written by Guilhem Bichot on 2006-04-27.
  Does not compile yet.
*/

/* Here is the implementation of this module */

/*
  Summary:
  - there are asynchronous checkpoints (a writer to the log notices that it's
  been a long time since we last checkpoint-ed, so posts a request for a
  background thread to do a checkpoint; does not care about the success of the
  checkpoint). Then the checkpoint is done by the checkpoint thread, at an
  unspecified moment ("later") (==soon, of course).
  - there are synchronous checkpoints: a thread requests a checkpoint to
  happen now and wants to know when it finishes and if it succeeded; then the
  checkpoint is done by that same thread.
