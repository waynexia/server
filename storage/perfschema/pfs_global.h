    ptr is typically an aligned structure,
    so the last bits are not really random, but this has no effect.
    Apply a factor A*x to spread
    close values of ptr further apart (which helps with arrays),
    and to spread values way beyond a typical max_size.
    Then, apply a modulo to end within [0, max_size - 1].
    A is big prime numbers, to avoid resonating with max_size,
    to have a uniform distribution in [0, max_size - 1].
    The value of A is chosen so that index(ptr) and index(ptr + N) (for arrays)
    are likely to be not similar for typical values of max_size
    (50, 100, 1000, etc).
    In other words, (sizeof(T)*A % max_size) should not be a small number,
    to avoid that with 'T array[max_size]', index(array[i])
    and index(array[i + 1]) end up pointing in the same area in [0, max_size - 1].
