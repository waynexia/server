  'lock' protects 'owners', 'state', and 'waiter_count'

  a resource is picked up from a hash in a lock-free manner
  it's returned pinned, so it cannot be freed at once

  to free a resource it should be
    1. have no owners
    2. have no waiters

  two ways to access a resource:
    1. find it in a hash
       - it's returned pinned.
        a) take a lock in exclusive mode
        b) check the state, it should be ACTIVE
        c) unpin
    2. by a direct reference
       - could only used if a resource cannot be freed
       e.g. accessing a resource by thd->waiting_for is safe,
       a resource cannot be freed as there's a thread waiting for it

    we need a special rwlock-like 'lock' to allow readers bypass
    waiting writers, otherwise readers can deadlock. For example:

      A waits on resource x, owned by B, B waits on resource y, owned
      by A, we have a cycle (A->x->B->y->A)
      Both A and B start deadlock detection:

        A locks x                          B locks y
        A goes deeper                      B goes deeper
        A locks y                          B locks x

      with mutexes it would deadlock. With rwlocks it won't, as long
      as both A and B are taking read locks (and they do).
      But other threads may take write locks. Assume there's
      C who wants to start waiting on x, and D who wants to start
      waiting on y.

        A read-locks x                       B read-locks y
        A goes deeper                        B goes deeper
     => C write-locks x (to add a new edge)  D write-locks y
     .. C is blocked                         D is blocked
        A read-locks y                       B read-locks x

      Now, if a read lock can bypass a pending wrote lock request, we're fine.
      If it can not, we have a deadlock.

    writer starvation is technically possible, but unlikely, because
    the contention is expected to be low.

    weight relates to the desirability of a transaction being killed if it's

    are killed first.

    Examples of using the weight to implement different selection strategies:

    1. Latest
        Keep all weights equal.
    2. Random
        Assight weights at random.
        (variant: modify a weight randomly before every lock request)
    3. Youngest
        Set weight to -NOW()
    4. Minimum locks
        count locks granted in your lock manager, store the value as a weight
    5. Minimum work
        depends on the definition of "work". For example, store the number
        of rows modifies in this transaction (or a length of REDO log for a
        transaction) as a weight.

    It is only statistically relevant and is not protected by any locks.
