          For example, imagine that we have following waiters graph:

                       ctxA -> obj1 -> ctxB -> obj1 -|
                        ^                            |

          and both ctxA and ctxB start deadlock detection process:

            ctxA read-locks obj1             ctxB read-locks obj2
            ctxA goes deeper                 ctxB goes deeper

          Now ctxC comes in who wants to start waiting on obj1, also
          ctxD comes in who wants to start waiting on obj2.

            ctxC tries to write-lock obj1   ctxD tries to write-lock obj2
            ctxC is blocked                 ctxD is blocked

          Now ctxA and ctxB resume their search:

            ctxA tries to read-lock obj2    ctxB tries to read-lock obj1

          If m_rwlock prefers writes (or fair) both ctxA and ctxB would be
          blocked because of pending write locks from ctxD and ctxC
          correspondingly. Thus we will get a deadlock in deadlock detector.
          If m_wrlock prefers readers (actually ignoring pending writers is
          enough) ctxA and ctxB will continue and no deadlock will occur.

  @param release_hook  Cleanup function to be called when MDL subsystem

  This is used to cache a pointer to TABLE_SHARE in the lock
  structure. Such caching can save one acquisition of LOCK_open
  and one table definition cache lookup for every table.

  Since the pointer may be stored only inside an acquired lock,
  the caching is only effective when there is more than one lock
  granted on a given table.

  This function has the following usage pattern:
    - try to acquire an MDL lock
    - when done, call for mdl_get_cached_object(). If it returns NULL, our
      thread has the only lock on this table.
    - look up TABLE_SHARE in the table definition cache
    - call mdl_set_cache_object() to assign the share to the opaque pointer.

 The release hook is invoked when the last shared metadata
 lock on this name is released.
