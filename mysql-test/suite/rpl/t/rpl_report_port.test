#BUG#13333431 : INCORRECT DEFAULT PORT IN 'SHOW SLAVE HOSTS' OUTPUT 
#
# ==== Purpose ====
#
# The test show the default value printed for the slave's port number if the 
# --report-port= <some value> is not set on the slave. This is different from
# the present scenario which show 3306 as the default value if the report-port 
# is not set on the slave. 
#
#====Method====
#
# Start replication with report port not set.This will give the actual port 
# number of the slave (ie. SLAVE_PORT) for the on doing SHOW SLAVE HOSTS on 
# the master.
# Restart the slave server with report port set to 9000 and start the slave.
# In this case on doing SHOW SLAVE HOSTS on the master, we get the port number
# of the slave to be 9000.

# Start the server with some value being passed to the report_port= <option>
# this will be used incase we have to mask the value of the slave's port
# number in certain situations.
