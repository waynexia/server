Windows building readme
======================================

The Windows build system uses a tool named CMake to generate build files for
a variety of project systems.  This tool is combined with a set of jscript
files to enable building of MySQL for Windows directly out of a bzr clone.
For relevant information and/or for building binaries from source distribution, 
please refer to http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/CMake
