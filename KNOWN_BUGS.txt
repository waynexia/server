This file should contain all know fatal bugs in the Maria storage
engine for the last source or binary release.  Minor bugs, extensions
and feature request and bugs found since this release can be find in the
MySQL bugs databases at: http://bugs.mysql.com/

There shouldn't normally be any bugs that affects normal operations in
any Maria release.  Still, there are always exceptions and edge cases
and that's what this file is for.

For the first few Alpha releases of Maria there may be some edge cases
that crashes during recovery; We don't like that but we think it's
better to get the Maria alpha out early to get things tested and get
more developers on the code early than wait until these are fixed.  We
do however think that the bugs are not seriously enough to stop anyone
from starting to test and even use Maria for real (as long as they are
prepared to upgrade to next MySQL-Maria release ASAP).

If you have found a bug that is not listed here, please add it to
http://bugs.mysql.com/ so that we can either fix it for next release
or in the worst case add it here for others to know!


Known bugs that are planned to be fixed before next minor release
=================================================================

- If the log files are damaged or inconsistent, Maria may fail to start.
  We should fix that if this happens and mysqld is restarted (thanks to
  mysqld_safe, instance manager or other script) it should disregard the
  old logs, start anyway and automaticly repair any tables that was found
  to be crashed on open.
  Temporary fix is to remove or maria_log.???????? files from the data
  directory, restart mysqld and run CHECK TABLE / REPAIR TABLE or 
  mysqlcheck on your Maria tables


Known bugs that are planned to be fixed before Beta
===================================================

- If we get a write failure on disk (disk full or disk error) for the
  log, we should stop all usage of transactional tables and mark all
  transactional tables that are changed as crashed.
  For the moment, if this happens, you have to take down mysqld,
  remove all logs, restart mysqld and repair your tables.

  If you get the related error:
  "Disk is full writing '/usr/local/mysql/var/maria_log.????????' (Errcode: 28)
   Waiting for someone to free space..."
  you should either free disk space, in which Maria will continue as before
  or kill mysqld, remove logs and repair tables.


Missing features that is planned to fix before Beta
===================================================

- We will add an maria-recover option to automaticly repair any
  crashed tables on open. (This is needed for not transactional tables
  and also in edge cases for transactional tables when the table
  crashed because of a bug in  MySQL or Maria code)
- Multiple concurrent inserts & multiple concurrent readers at same time
  with full MVCC control.  Note that UPDATE and DELETE will still be
  blocking (as with MyISAM)
- COUNT(*) and TABLE CHECKSUM under MVCC (ie, they are instant and kept up
  to date even with multiple inserter)
- Recovery of fulltext and GIS indexes.


Features planned for future releases
